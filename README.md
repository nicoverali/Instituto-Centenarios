## General info

My high school used to have an outdated website, so I took the same content but **redesigned it entirely to provide a better experience to visitors**.

I decided to make a static website with Jekyll to take advantage of Github Pages. I also use the Bootstrap Grid to make the website **responsive**.

The website has three main sections, a newspaper, videos made by students, and a contact section.

## Technologies

- Jekyll
- Bootstrap Grid
- SASS
- Github pages

## Status

Currently, I'm not working anymore on this page, but it's online at the moment.
